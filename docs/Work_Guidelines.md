# Project Work Guidelines

To ensure a smooth workflow and maintain the integrity of our codebase, 
please follow these guidelines:

## Development Workflow:
- Work **EXCLUSIVELY** on the dev branch. All coding, testing, and feature additions **should** be done here. 
- This keeps our main codebase stable and prevents potential issues.
- Test and verify code thoroughly before considering a merge to main.

## Merging into main:
- Only merge code into main after **confirming** it is fully **functional** and stable. 
- This helps protect our code from errors and minimizes setbacks.

## Purpose of These Guidelines:
- Following these practices ensures our code remains organized and protected, supporting an efficient development process and reducing risks of unexpected issues.
